# What is the Slope of a Line?
The slope of a line is the line's rate of change. It is commonly denoted by  $m$. To find the slope of a linear equation, the formula $m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$ can be used, where $x_1$ and $y_1$ are the x- and y-coordinates of the first point and $x_2$ and $y_2$ are the x- and y-coordinates of the second point. ^03193e

# Slope of Perpendicular Lines
The slope of a line perpendicular to a line who's slope we know can be found using $m_2=-\frac{1}{m_1}$, where $m_1$ is the known slope of the first line and $m_2$ is the unknown slope of the second line. ^784681
