# Introduction
The slope-intercept form, $y = mx + b$, is a simple way to write a linear equation by specifying the [[Slope|slope]], $m$, and the y-intercept, $b$.

# Use
The slope-intercept form is useful for simple equations or functions where there is a starting value and a set rate of change, where the starting value is the y-intercept, or $b$, and the rate of change is the [[Slope|slope]], or $m$.

# Finding the Slope-Intercept Form using two Points
Given two points, lets say $(-9, 18)$ and $(1, 2)$ we can find the slope-intercept form by first finding the slope, and then using that to find the y-intercept. 
To find the [[Slope|slope]] we can use $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. After substituting our coordinates into the formula we get $m = \frac{2 - 18}{1 - (-9)}$. We can solve for $m$ to get $m = -1.6$.
The final step in finding the slope-intercept form using the two points is to find the y-intercept. To do so, we can substitute the coordinates of one of our points along with the slope into the slope-intercept form and solving for $b$. After substituting these values into the slope-intercept form we get $2 = -1.6(1) + b$. Solving for $b$ gives us $b = 3.6$.
Putting it all together gives us the slope-intercept form of a linear line passing through our given points, $(-9, 18)$ and $(1, 2)$:
$$y = -1.6x + 3.6$$ ^1c8195
