# Introduction
The standard form of linear equations is $Ax + By = C$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are integers and $A$ and $B$ are non-zero numbers. ^e3c52c

# Transforming Standard Form into the Slope-Intercept Form
To transform the standard form of linear equations into the [[Slope-Intercept Form|slope-intercept form]], we can solve for and isolate $y$.  ^142bdf

## Example
For example, $5y - 3x = 6$ can be transformed into slope-intercept form by isolating $5y$ to get $5y = 3x + 6$. Next, we can remove $y$'s coefficient to get $y = \frac{3x+6}{5}$. Finally, we simplify to get $y = 0.6x + 1.2$. ^d368f1
