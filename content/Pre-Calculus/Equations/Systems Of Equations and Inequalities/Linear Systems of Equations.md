Linear systems of equations are systems with 2 linear equations (as opposed to a linear equation and a quadratic equation or 2 quadratic equations). Generally, these can be easily solved via substitution or elimination. An example of a linear system of equations is the following:
$$y=x$$
$$2y=3x-2$$ ^d6e4a7

# Solving via Substitution:
$$y=x$$
$$2y=3x-2$$
$$ \\ $$
$$y=x$$
$$y=\frac{3x-2}{2}$$
$$ \\ $$
$$y=x$$
$$y=1.5x-1$$
$$ \\ $$
$$\text{Substitute } y \text{ in the second equation for the right side of the first equation:}$$
$$x=1.5x-1$$
$$0=0.5x-1$$
$$1=0.5x$$
$$x=2$$ ^0de04c

# Solving via Elimination
$$y=x$$
$$2y=3x-2$$
$$ \\ $$
$$y=x$$
$$\frac{2y}{-2}=\frac{3x-2}{-2}$$
$$ \\ $$
$$y=x$$
$$-y=-1.5x+1$$
$$ \\ $$
$$\text{Add both equations together:}$$
$$y+(-y)=x+(-1.5x+1)$$
$$0=-0.5x+1$$
$$0.5x=1$$
$$x=2$$ ^12b6fc

# Is Solving via Substitution or Elimination Superior?
Neither one is better than the other, the only reason you might want to use one method over the other is that one method is far quicker than the other for the given system. An example of a system where elimination is great is the following.
$$5-y=3x$$
$$y=x-8$$
$$ \\ $$
The reason this equation is quicker to solve with elimination than substitution is because the equations can be added together without first having to do additional transformation(s) to make a variable cancel out.
