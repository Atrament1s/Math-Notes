# Systems of Equations
A system of equation is a set of two or more equations. On their own, these equations are not solvable for a specific point. However, with two or more equations, this becomes possible through methods such as substitution. When solving for a system of equations the solution(s) will be where the two equations intersect each other.

# Systems of Inequalities
Systems of inequalities are solved in the same way as systems of equations with one difference. <u>Whenever you divide or multiply by a negative number, the signs need to be flipped in addition to the usual results of the operation.</u>
