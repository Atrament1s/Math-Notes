# Definition
The coordinate increment is denoted by $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ for the increment in the x- and y-coordinates, respectively. ^af4588

# How to find
To find the $\Delta x$, aka the difference between the x-coordinates of the two points, we can use the formula $\Delta x = x_2 - x_1$. Likewise, we can find the $\Delta y$ with the formula $\Delta y = y_2 - y_1$. ^27e978

# Substituting into the Slope Formula
Since slope is found using $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$, and the increments are found using $\Delta y = y_2 - y_1$ and $\Delta x = x_2 - x_1$, we can substitute the increments into the slope formula to get $m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$. ^eb62d1
