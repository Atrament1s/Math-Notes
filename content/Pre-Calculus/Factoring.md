To factor something means to write something as the product of several factors. An example of this is the following.
$$x^2+4x-5$$
$$(x+5)(x-1)$$
$$ \\ $$
When factoring a quadratic in the form $ax^2+bx+c$ the factors will be $(a_1+b_1)$ and $(a_2+b_2)$ where the following is true. 
$$a=a_1*a_2$$
$$b=a_1*b_2+b_1*a_2$$
$$c=b_1*b_2$$
