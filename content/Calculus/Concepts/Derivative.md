# How to find the Derivative Forumula
The derivative, also known as the instantaneous rate of change, can be found using the [[Average Rate of Change|average rate of change]] formula and decreasing the time interval to an infinitely small number. Instead of using variables $a$ and $b$, we will use variables $x$ and $h$ where $h$ approaches zero.
To get the derivative formula, we can take the [[Average Rate of Change|average rate of change]] formula and represent the top end of the interval as the bottom end plus $h$.
$$\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{(a+h)-a}$$ ^a855ba

This can be simplified to the following equation.
$$\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$$ ^f6c06e

To show that $h$ approaches zero, we can add a [[Limits|limit]].
$$\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f\left(a+h\right)-f\left(a\right)}{h}$$ ^3ab267

# Definition
The derivative is the slope of the tangent line at a given x-value.  ^1aa702

## Example
For example, the derivative of $f\left(x\right)=4.9x^2$ is $f'\left(x\right)=9.8x$ (as shown [[Limits#^e6e02a|here]]). If we want to find the slope of the tangent line of $f\left(x\right)$ at $x=5$ we can substitute $5$ into the derivative of $f\left(x\right)$. By substituting $5$ into $f'\left(x\right)=9.8x$ we get $49$, which means that the slope of the tangent line at $x=5$ is $49$. ^553583
