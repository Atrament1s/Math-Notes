# The Number $e$ and Compound Interest

## The number $e$
The constant $e$, also known as Euler's number, is a non-terminating and non-repeating decimal defined as the following.
$$e=\lim_{x\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)^x$$
$$e\approx 2.718281828$$

## Compound Interest Function
The compound interest formula is defined as the following where <q>$P$ is the principle amount, $r$ is the interest rate, $t$ is the length of time in years, and $n$ is the number of times interest is compounded in 1 year.</q>
$$A=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$$

The continuously compounding interest function is $A=Pe^{rt}$.
