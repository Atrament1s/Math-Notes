# Essential Questions
- Why is it possible for a two-sided limit to exist at a point while the function is undefined at that point?
- Why do some limits exist while other limits do not?
- How are limits useful in determining whether a function is continuous at a value in the function's domain?

# Objectives
- Determine average and instantaneous rates of change using the idea of limits
- Estimate limits from information given in tables and graphs

# Key Words
- [[Average Rate of Change|average rate of change]]
- average speed
- free fall
- [[Derivative|instantaneous rate of change]]
- instantaneous speed
