## Example
To find the slope and coordinate increments of the linear line passing through $A(-2.5, -1.5)$ and $B(-4.1, 3.7)$, we can plug the values into our slope formula, $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$, to get $m = \frac{3.7-(-1.5)}{-4.1-(-2.5)}$. When can then simplify the numerator and denominator to get $m = \frac{5.2}{-1.6}$.

Recall that the slope is also calculable using $m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$. Because of this, we know that the numerator in $m = \frac{5.2}{-1.6}$ has to be equal to $\Delta y$ and that the denominator has to be equal to $\Delta x$.

Finally, we can solve for m in $m = \frac{5.2}{-1.6}$ to get $m = -3.25$. This leaves us with the following solutions.
$$\Delta x = -1.6$$
$$\Delta y = 5.2$$
$$m = -3.25$$

## Finding the x- and y- intercepts of an Equation
To find the x- and y- intercepts of an equation, you can set $y$ and $x$ to zero, respectively. This means that if you wanted to find the x-intercept, you would set $y$ to zero and solve for $x$. Likewise, if you wanted to find the y-intercept, you would set $x$ to zero and solve for $y$.
